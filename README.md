# AMELIA - Social Trip Planner

### Project 2 for UUBC: Daniel, Claire, Hunter, Hayder
Our project is aimed at the goal of helping busy people travel easier. Our product allows users to develop, plan, share, and collaborate on their upcoming adventure.

We believed we should spend time developing this service as this is something each of our team members wished they had when planning their last adventure. 

The result of us solving this problem is a one-stop shop service that allows users to develop, plan, share, and collaborate on their past, present, and future vacations.

In our project, we used both node and express servers. Our project was backed by a MySQL database with a sequelize ORM. We had various GET and POST routes. These routes allowed us to add new and retrieve all data. It utilizes one new library of images that we have not yet discussed in class: PassportJS. This allowed us to securely handle user registration and authentication.
